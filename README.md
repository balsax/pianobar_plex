# pianobar_plex
This is a modified version of Pianobar that saves songs to local harddrive every few seconds.
A config file needs to be created in ~/.config/pianobar/config which has save destination (same as pianobar-save project)
I wrote this for my own use and did not focus on making it cross compatiable.  This also has a beta that creates playlists which is hardcoded at the end of player.c
This works on ubuntu 17.10 assuming drivers are installed (follow directions for building pianobar)


Below is original readme...
